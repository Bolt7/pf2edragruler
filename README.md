As with dragruler colours are non-customizable. However, the first range increment has been given a set colour and all drag distance colours have been chosen such that they should be distinguishable for people with protanopia, deuteranopia, or tritanopia.

At present only supports land speed. A goal for future releases is to automatically switch to flying speed for positive elevations, or for creatures without land speeds. Presently for creatures with no land speed, if you wish you make use of the drag ruler it recommended you set their land speed equal to their fly speed.
