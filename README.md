Drag Ruler now supports customizable colours. Default colours have been set for PF2E integration such that they should be distinguishable for people with protanopia, deuteranopia, or tritanopia.

Automatically switches to use fly speed, if a creature has one, when a token is elevated. If a creature has no fly speed the ruler will instead use the default land speed when tokens are elevated.
